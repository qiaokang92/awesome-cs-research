# Awesome Computer Science Research

Tools and best practices for CS researchers.

This project is inspired by [awesome-research](https://github.com/emptymalei/awesome-research).
However, this project applies broadly for all researchers in different fields.
We are working on this repo to help computer scientists researchers and developers
(including PhD. students, faculties, scientists, researchers and engineers in
industry or academia) know more useful tools. And we will allow people to share
their ideas for the best practices in doing computer system research.

This project would be very helpful for new owls in CS field
(e.g., 1st-year PhD. students) to quickly hit the road. Somehow it would also
suprise you even you are senior - everyone wants a faster horse before cars
were invented.
